  embed_description: |
    Hello! I am your security bot, **{bot_name}**. My main task is to protect your server, **{guild_name}**, from unauthorized actions and attacks.

    For me to do my job effectively, please complete a few simple but very important steps:
  field_roles_title: "‚ö†Ô∏è Crucial Step: Role Hierarchy"
  field_roles_value: |
    In order for me to control the actions of **all** members, including administrators, my role must be placed **as high as possible** in your server's role list.

    **Please go to `Server Settings` > `Roles` and drag the `{bot_name}` role ABOVE the administrator and moderator roles.** The ideal position is at the very top of the list.

    *This will allow me to revert dangerous actions and quarantine any offender, regardless of their permissions.*
  field_setup_title: "üöÄ Initial Setup"
  field_setup_value: |
    These commands are the key to the bot's full functionality.

    **1. Quarantine Setup (REQUIRED)**
    This is the most important command. It creates a special role where users suspected of attacking the server will be placed.
    `/setup quarantine configure`

    **2. Create Your First Backup (RECOMMENDED)**
    Immediately after setup, create the first snapshot of your server. This is your recovery point in case of any trouble.
    `/backup create`

    **3. Check the Bot Whitelist**
    If you have other trusted bots on your server, add them to the whitelist, or I might ban them.
    `/botlist add`

    **4. Set Language (Optional)**
    By default, I respond in Russian (`RU`). If you want me to communicate in English, use this command:
    `/setup language set`
  field_moderation_title: "üõ†Ô∏è Configure Moderation"
  field_moderation_value: |
    The bot is equipped with an advanced mute and warning system. For it to work correctly, please use the commands:
    `/setup logs set` - to set a moderation log channel.
    `/warns setup` - to configure auto-mutes for warnings.
  field_telegram_title: "üîî Get Alerts in Telegram"
  field_telegram_value: |
    You can set up instant notifications for all incidents directly to your Telegram. This is especially useful if you are not always on Discord.
    `/setup telegram configure`
  field_help_title: "‚ÑπÔ∏è Help & Audit"
  field_help_value: "For a full list of commands, use `/help`. To see a summary of all your servers, DM me the `/my_servers` command."
  author_info_title: " ‚Äé"
  author_info_value: "Creator: <@{owner_id}> | [Support Server]({invite_link})"
  footer_text: "Your personal server guardian"

  initial_title: "Security Bot Help Center"

      These two commands are key to the bot's full functionality. It is highly recommended to configure them immediately after adding the bot to your server.

      **1. Quarantine Setup (REQUIRED)**
      This is the most important command. It creates a special `üö´ Quarantine` role where users suspected of attacking the server will be placed. Without this role, the protection system cannot isolate offenders.
      `/setup quarantine configure`

      **2. Language Setup**
      By default, I respond in Russian (`RU`). If you want me to communicate in English, use this command:
      `/setup language set`

  category_management:
    label: "‚öôÔ∏è Management & Settings"
    title: "‚öôÔ∏è Management & Settings"
    description: |
      These commands will help you manage the bot and fine-tune its behavior.

      **Backup System:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/backup create` - Create a full snapshot of the server (roles, channels, perms, messages).
      ‚Ä¢ `/backup list` - Show all available backups.
      ‚Ä¢ `/backup restore` - Restore the server from a backup.
      ‚Ä¢ `/backup delete` - Delete an unneeded backup.
      ‚Ä¢ `/backup clone` - **(DANGEROUS!)** Clone the structure of another one of your servers onto this one. **All members will lose their roles!**

      **Manage Bot Whitelist:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/botlist add` - Add a trusted bot so I don't ban it.
      ‚Ä¢ `/botlist remove` - Remove a bot from the whitelist.
      ‚Ä¢ `/botlist list` - Show all bots on the whitelist.

      **Manage Quarantine:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/quarantine list` - Show everyone currently in quarantine, with options to ban them or restore their roles.
      
      **Direct Message Commands:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/my_servers` - (DM the bot only) Shows a dashboard with a summary for all your servers.

      **Fine-tune Anti-nuke:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/setup antinuke configure` - Change the "threat scores" for different actions. For advanced users.
      ‚Ä¢ `/setup antinuke view` - See the current score values.

      **Configure Telegram Notifications:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/setup telegram configure` - Set up sending critical notifications to your Telegram.
      
  category_moderation:
    label: "üõ†Ô∏è Moderation"
    title: "üõ†Ô∏è Moderation Commands"
    description: |
      These commands allow your moderators to maintain order on the server.

      **Member Timeout (Mute):**
      ‚Ä¢ `/mute [member]` - Timeout a member, preventing them from speaking or writing. Opens a convenient modal for duration and reason.
      ‚Ä¢ `/unmute [member]` - Remove a timeout.
      ‚Ä¢ `/muted` - Show a paginated list of all members currently in timeout.

      **Warning System:**
      ‚Ä¢ `/warns add [member]` - Issue a warning.
      ‚Ä¢ `/warns list [member]` - Show a member's warning history.
      ‚Ä¢ `/warns remove [member] [id]` - Remove a specific warning.
      ‚Ä¢ `/warns setup` - Configure how many warns lead to an auto-mute and for how long.
      ‚Ä¢ `/warns setup-lifetime` - Configure how many days until warnings expire.
      ‚Ä¢ `/warns settings` - Show the current settings for the warning system.

    title: "üõ°Ô∏è How does the protection work?"
    description: |
      My security system consists of two layers:

      **1. Proactive Protection (Confirmations)**
      When a moderator tries to perform a potentially dangerous action (like granting a role with administrator rights or creating a webhook), I immediately revert the action and send you a direct message requesting confirmation. Only after your approval will the action be executed. This prevents accidental or malicious changes.

      **2. Reactive Protection (Anti-nuke)**
      I monitor rapid, mass actions characteristic of crash raids (mass channel deletion, bans, role creation). Each such action adds "threat points" to the moderator. If they accumulate a critical number of points in a short time, I automatically place them in quarantine, stripping them of all permissions and notifying you. This stops an attack even if you are offline.

      This two-layer system provides comprehensive protection for your server.
